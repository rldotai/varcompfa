"""
Temporal difference learning, AKA TD(λ), an on-policy linear-time online
learning algorithm

This is one of the foundational algorithms of reinforcement learning.
See the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto for
a full introduction, in particular Chapter 7.

The algorithm is given in pseudocode on Rich Sutton's website[0].

It is known to converge in the on-policy setting under mild technical conditions,
although the fixed-point it converges to changes depending on the bootstrapping 
parameter, λ.
For λ=0 we bootstrap the value of each state from the reward and the value of its 
successor; this tends to converge quickly but its solution may be different from
the true value function (and its least-squares approximation).
With λ=1 we get effectively an online, every-visit Monte-Carlo method for 
estimating state value which may be more accurate, but tends to have a higher 
variance.

In pseudo-LaTeX, the update equations look like:

    δ_{t}   = R_{t+1} + γ_{t+1} w_{t}^T x_{t+1} - w_{t}^{T} x_{t} 
    e_{t}   = ρ_{t} (λ_{t} γ_{t} e_{t-1} + x_{t})
    w_{t+1} = w_{t} + α δ_{t} e_{t}

Where:
    - δ refers to the temporal difference error
    - γ is the discount parameter
    - λ is the bootstrapping parameter
    - α is the stepsize parameter 
    - w is the weight vector
    - e is the eligibility trace
    - x and r are feature vectors and rewards respectively

This version of TD(λ) is an on-policy algorithm, so it doesn't respond
well to updates from trajectories generated via policies other than the one
it is currently evaluating.
There are a slew of modifications that can allow for off-policy evaluation,
for example: GTD(λ), ETD(λ), and other importance sampling methods.
Here, we employ accumulating traces (vs. replacing traces or dutch traces),
although modifying the code for different traces is straightforward.

    The version implemented here uses general value functions (GVFs), meaning that

    If that doesn't seem germane to your problem, just use a constant value for them.

            The step-size parameter for updating the weight vector.

        -----
        Features (`x` and `xp`) are assumed to be 1D arrays of length `self.n`.
