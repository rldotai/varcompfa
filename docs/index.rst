Varcompfa
=====================================

Welcome to the somewhat broken documentation for ``varcompfa``.

This project started out as a repo for conducting **var**\ iance **comp**\ arison experiments under **f**\ unction **a**\ pproximation, but is now a more generic engine for testing reinforcement learning algorithms in general.

Most of the documentation is in the docstrings of the codebase, and there are examples of how to use the code in the project's ``examples`` and ``notebooks`` directories.
Unfortunately, generating nice documentation from docstrings is still difficult,
so please excuse some possibly weird formatting.
