# Installation

I have yet to figure out how to upload this repo as a package on PyPI, so you're going to have to install from source.

1. Download the code from [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/rldotai/varcompfa)
2. Install using `pip`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rldotai/varcompfa.git
pip install ./varcompfa
```

## Development Version

If you intend on modifying the code, you should probably install it such that the package is editable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rldotai/varcompfa.git
pip install --editable ./varcompfa
```
