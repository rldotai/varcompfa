# Overview

The `varcompfa` package was originally just the code for some quick experiments, but what those experiments might entail was open-ended enough that I wrote it to be somewhat general, and as a result produced an engine/framework for running arbitrary reinforcement learning experiments.

It includes environments that are compatible with OpenAI's `gym` package, a variety of linear-function approximation reinforcement learning agents, along with code for actually running the experiments and recording the results.
